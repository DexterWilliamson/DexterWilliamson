My name is Dexter Williamson and I have a lot of hobbies/interests.
Currently I am going to school to become a Data Analyst.
To start with I am a skilled Python programmer, HTML5/CSS are second nature to me, and I am familiar with C# and Java.
I have experience working with Django, SQL, Jupyter Notebooks,and many more.
I am running a small home server operation that will hopefully get bigger.
(2 Aruba 2930 switches, Dell R720xd running esxi, 846BA Supermicro running TrueNAS Core).
